                <h2>GOOGLE: PIXEL 4</h2>
                <p>
                    There's been an incredible flood of Pixel 4 leaks of late, which followed a series of official images released by Google to stem previous leaks... and then there have been more official images since. In short: the official images confirmed the leaks, and that cycle keeps on continuing ahead.

                <h2>ONEPLUS: 7T</h2>
                <p>
                    It was pretty much official, but now it's officially official: the OnePlus 7T is coming soon. Oh, and we've already reviewed it. Surprise!

This five-star update to the overly familiar OnePlus 7 brings more substantial changes, most notably the same kind of 90Hz screen refresh rate as the OnePlus 7 Pro. That makes everything feel super smooth and swift, although this 6.55in panel is still at 1080p resolution.</p>

                <h2>HUAWEI:MATE 30</h2>
                <p>
                    Huawei's Mate 30 and Mate 30 Pro are official... and they officially won't come with Google apps and services. That's a huge shame.

Still, the hardware looks fantastic. The Mate 30 Pro (shown) is the standout, of course, and it comes with steep waterfall-style sides on the curved screen, as well as a big center camera module on the back. With the new Kirin 990 chip, a quad-camera array, and 3D facial scanning on the front, it's a power-packed beauty. But it's also quite pricey at â‚¬1099.</p>
